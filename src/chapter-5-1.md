Training programs, workshops, and seminars are all effective ways to educate employees about AI. These initiatives should not only cover the technical aspects of AI, but also address the ethical and societal implications of the technology.

In addition to formal training programs, organizations can also foster a culture of continuous learning by encouraging employees to stay up-to-date with the latest developments in AI and providing resources such as industry publications, conferences, and online courses.
